# Vector3 Class in C++

This C++ program defines a simple **templated 3D vector class (`Vector3<T>`)** to perform basic vector operations commonly used in mathematics, physics, and computer graphics.

Description:


# Features

The `Vector3<T>` class provides the following functionalities:

- *Vector Addition (`+`)* 
- *Scalar Multiplication (`*`)*
- *Dot Product*
- *Cross Product*
- *Normalization (Unit Vector)*
- *Formatted Output (Print)*



# How to compile:
we can save it by 
   .cpp format
and Run it in the platform that we are going to use.


# How to Run (For Assessment Purpose)

1. Go to [Online Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)
2. Copy the code into the editor
3. Click *Run*








## Example Usage

The program demonstrates operations on two 3D vectors:

```cpp
Vector3<float> a(1.0f, 5.0f, 3.0f);
Vector3<float> b(7.0f, 4.0f, 8.0f);




# Example Output:


Mean: 21.3333
Median: 22
Variance: 181.333
Standard Deviation: 13.466




# Highlights

- Uses **C++ Templates** to support any numeric type (e.g., `float`, `double`, `int`).
- Suitable for basic **3D vector algebra**.
- Great for educational purposes or small-scale geometry simulations.
